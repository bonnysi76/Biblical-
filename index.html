  <h1>“The Furnace of Flesh”</h1>
  <h2>A Divine Comedy-style Lament on Sin, Lust, and Agony</h2>

  <p><em>“In sin did my mother conceive me”</em> — so I cried,<br>
  From the mire of my soul, where the light had long died (Psalm 51:5).<br>
  I was drawn like a lamb, not to slaughter—but shame,<br>
  Led captive by lust, and my bones burned with flame (James 1:14-15).</p>

  <p>My iniquities rise like a flood in my chest,<br>
  “Too heavy for me” — I find no rest (Psalm 38:4).<br>
  I am “a worm and not a man,” despised of the race (Psalm 22:6),<br>
  And demons have hungered to tear off my face.</p>

  <p>I sought You in groanings that break through the night (Romans 8:26),<br>
  Yet my eyes failed with watching for Your light (Psalm 69:3).<br>
  “Create in me a clean heart,” I cry in despair (Psalm 51:10),<br>
  But my prayers fall back down, dissolved in the air (Lamentations 3:44).</p>

  <p>I thirst for You “as in a dry land” (Psalm 63:1),<br>
  But my hands are defiled, and can’t touch the Lamb (Isaiah 59:2-3).<br>
  My flesh cries aloud like a beast in a cage,<br>
  “Deliver me from this body of death and rage!” (Romans 7:24).</p>

  <blockquote>“Woe to the rebellious children,” says the Lord (Isaiah 30:1),<br>
  And I—the prodigal—spend all I can hoard.</blockquote>

  <p>The harlot has beckoned with lips dipped in lies (Proverbs 5:3),<br>
  I followed her chamber down death’s disguise (Proverbs 7:27).</p>

  <p>I wept with Esau, seeking place for repentance (Hebrews 12:17),<br>
  But found none, only silence and stiffened resistance.<br>
  My conscience is seared (1 Timothy 4:2), my affections defiled (Titus 1:15),<br>
  And lust whispers sweet in the voice of the vile.</p>

  <p>The plague of my heart—no physician can cure (Jeremiah 17:9),<br>
  No balm in Gilead, no ointment pure (Jeremiah 8:22).<br>
  I fasted, I wept, I tore robes in vain,<br>
  But my sin, like scarlet, still leaves the same stain (Isaiah 1:18).</p>

  <blockquote>“They have eyes full of adultery,” You said (2 Peter 2:14),<br>
  “They never cease sinning,” and their spirits are dead.</blockquote>

  <p>I am them. I am he. I am dust and despair.<br>
  “Why have You forsaken me?” hangs in the air (Matthew 27:46).</p>

  <p>My soul cleaves to the dust—revive me by Word (Psalm 119:25),<br>
  But my ears are too dull; Your voice is not heard (Isaiah 6:10).<br>
  I am “given to the desires of my heart” (Romans 1:24),<br>
  And my hands build again what once was torn apart (Galatians 2:18).</p>

  <p>“Wash me,” I beg, “and I shall be clean” (Psalm 51:7),<br>
  But the waters run red—still cursed and unclean (Leviticus 13:45).<br>
  Your Spirit withdrew, and Ichabod stayed,<br>
  And demons sat feasting where my conscience decayed (1 Samuel 4:21).</p>

  <p>I remembered Your law but delighted no more (Psalm 1:2),<br>
  My fruit rotted slowly from the root to the core (Matthew 7:19).<br>
  Though I “buffet my body and bring it to slave” (1 Corinthians 9:27),<br>
  It rises again, like a corpse from the grave.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>“Why do You stand far off, O Lord?” (Psalm 10:1)<br>
  “Why hide in times of trouble?”—Have I not implored?<br>
  With sackcloth of mourning I covered my face (Psalm 35:13),<br>
  But sin laughs in echoes and mocks all my grace.</p>

  <p>Yet still I remember the days of Your hand (Psalm 143:5),<br>
  When You “brought me up from the miry land” (Psalm 40:2).<br>
  Will You forget me forever, O King? (Psalm 13:1)<br>
  Shall I dwell in the pit where no angels sing?</p>

  <p>Though I fall seven times, can I rise again? (Proverbs 24:16)<br>
  Or am I the dog returning to sin? (2 Peter 2:22).<br>
  My tears have been food both day and by night (Psalm 42:3),<br>
  And still I grope blindly, shut off from Your light.</p>

  <p>I see no deliverer—none righteous remains (Romans 3:10),<br>
  Only “wretched man that I am,” bound in chains (Romans 7:24).<br>
  Is there balm for the broken? Hope for the lost?<br>
  Or was I ordained to be damned from the Cross?</p>

  <blockquote>But even now… I remember Your Name (Psalm 119:55),<br>
  And though I am ash, still I call just the same.<br>
  If grace is for sinners, then who sins like me? (Luke 5:32)<br>
  I stretch out my hands—O God, rescue me! (Psalm 143:6)</blockquote>
