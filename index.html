                <p>In a lot of churches today, long prayers are praised, and short ones are seen as weak or immature. Some people even rush into speaking in tongues just to "push time" when they’ve actually run out of things to say. But is that what God wants—or is it just performance?</p>
                
                <p>Let’s be clear: <strong>God doesn’t care about how long you pray—He cares about <em>why</em> you’re praying.</strong></p>

                <p>Jesus Himself warned against using too many words just to sound spiritual. <strong>Matthew 6:7 (NIV)</strong> says, <q>“And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.”</q> This hits straight at the idea that more words = more power. They don’t.</p>

                <p>Right after that, Jesus gave us the Lord’s Prayer (<strong>Matthew 6:9–13</strong>), a focused, sincere prayer that takes less than 30 seconds to say. That wasn’t random—that was Jesus showing that prayer should be <em>real</em>, not <em>rambled</em>.</p>

                <p>Some people try to “stretch” prayer time by rapidly speaking in tongues, not out of spiritual overflow, but to <em>look</em> like they’re still praying. That’s not Spirit-led—that’s stalling. The Bible talks about the gift of tongues in <strong>1 Corinthians 14</strong>, but always emphasizes order, understanding, and edification. It was never meant to be a filler or a show.</p>
                
                <p>Even Jesus’ own prayers were often short and powerful—like <q>“Father, forgive them”</q> (<strong>Luke 23:34</strong>) and <q>“Into your hands I commit my spirit”</q> (<strong>Luke 23:46</strong>).</p>
                
                <p>And in <strong>Mark 12:40</strong>, He condemned the religious leaders who made long prayers just to impress others, saying they would be <q>“punished most severely.”</q></p>
                
                <p>Now, to be fair, <strong>long prayers can be good</strong>—Jesus prayed all night before choosing His disciples (<strong>Luke 6:12</strong>)—but only when they’re led by genuine connection with God, not pressure or performance.</p>

                <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Prayer isn’t about time. It’s about truth. Short, long, in tongues, or in silence—what matters is the <strong>authenticity</strong>, not the appearance. So stop watching the clock. God’s not. He’s watching your heart.</p>
